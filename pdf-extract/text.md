Turning Waste into Opportunity 
Bin to Better believes that waste isn’t just trash, it’s an opportunity. Every year countless items with value and 
potential end up in landfills simply because they no longer serve their original purpose. Our motivation is to change 
that narrative. 
We are driven by a simple yet powerful idea: that one person’s excess can be another’s solution. Whether it’s used 
tennis balls, old electronics or other overlooked resources, we connect those who have with those who need. By 
building bridges between individuals, communities and organizations, we promote a culture of reuse and responsible 
recycling. 
Through education, partnerships and hands‑on initiatives, Bin to Better empowers people to rethink waste and 
become part of a more sustainable, circular future. Together we can turn what would have been discarded into 
something better, for people, for communities and for the planet.

Testimonial 
“Thank you very much for your donation of 140 gently used tennis balls to my third grade Spanish immersion 
classroom at Blacow Elementary School. Cutting each individual ball so that it can fit each student leg chair must 
have been a lot of work!  We are so appreciative of your time and effort in giving the tennis balls a new second life 
instead of throwing then into the landfill. 
 
Your donation has been well received by my students. Their chairs are way gentler on the waxed floors and is saving 
the floors from being scratched. Most importantly classroom activity transitions are so much more quiet as the 
students get up from or come to sit in their chairs.

I was actually contemplating buying a class set of such tennis balls before your offer to donate them came to me at 
the end of last school year.  In a profesion where we have to provide most of our classroom supplies and such 
materials your donation saved me from having to spend my own money to have this great addition to my classroom. 
 
Much appreciation for your thoughtfulness. 
 
Thank you, thank you!”  
-​
Andrea MacKenzie, 3rd grade Spanish Immersion Teacher, Blacow Elementary 
 
“Thank you so much for dropping off the balls at the doggy day camp! The dogs absolutely love them, and I 
truly appreciate it as well. Whether they’re playing or just need something to chew on when they’re feeling 
stressed, those balls bring them so much joy. Your thoughtful contribution has made a big difference in 
supporting the pups here. We’re incredibly grateful for your kindness and generosity. Thank you again, and 
we wish you all the best.” 
— Allie, owner of Allie’s Doggie Day Camp 
 
“My experience with Bin to Better has been extremely positive. The team was very thoughtful and communicated 
clearly throughout the entire process. The donated tennis balls have made a noticeable difference in my 
classroom by significantly reducing noise from chairs/desks. This has helped create a calmer and more focused 
learning environment where students can concentrate better and transitions are much smoother. This is 
especially helpful when we are moving the chairs around for group work. It is a simple solution that has had a 
real and positive impact on daily classroom learning.”  
-​
Grace Shin, Irvington High School Teacher 
"Bin to Better did a great service to my classroom! They personally came to help me install the tennis balls on the 
chair legs, and now the classroom is much quieter and more productive. The floors are safer and protected from 
the chairs scraping against them, and the students were so surprised to see how the tennis balls could be 
repurposed into something new! I would highly recommend them to any classroom." 
-​
Brandon Lee, Oliveira Elementary TK Teacher 
“Adding tennis balls to our chair legs has made an immediate difference in our third-grade classroom. The 
reduced noise has helped students focus during reading and small-group work, and transitions are smoother 
because the room stays calm. It’s a simple change with a big impact on learning.”

About 
Our Mission & Vision

## Page 5

At Bin to Better, we believe that waste isn’t just trash, it’s an opportunity. Countless items with value end up in 
landfills each year simply because they no longer serve their original purpose. We are committed to changing that 
narrative by promoting reuse, responsible recycling and the circular economy. 
Our goal is to empower individuals and communities to rethink waste and realize that what seems like rubbish can 
become a resource for someone else. By connecting people with excess to those with needs, we bridge gaps and 
foster a culture of giving and sustainability. 
Origin Story 
Two high school students founded Bin to Better, Lalit Sreekar Batchu and Rohan Sashank Babbellapati, who 
witnessed firsthand the scale of everyday waste. Rohan, an avid tennis player on his school team, noticed how 
quickly tennis balls were discarded after just a few uses, even though they remained perfectly usable in other 
contexts. He approached Lalit with the idea of starting an organization that could repurpose these items. Together 
they launched Bin to Better to give new purpose to what others might throw away. 
Our Approach 
We focus on three pillars: 
Education: Through workshops and outreach we teach communities about the importance of reuse, recycling and 
sustainability. 
Partnerships: We collaborate with tennis clubs, schools, animal shelters and other organizations to collect unused 
materials and distribute them to those in need. 
Hands‑on Initiatives: Our projects provide tangible ways for volunteers to participate, collecting tennis balls, 
disassembling electronics or repurposing plastic waste into building materials. 
Together, these efforts empower people to become part of a more sustainable, circular future. 
  
Partners 
Working Together 
Our mission wouldn’t be possible without the support of our partners. We collaborate with a wide range of 
organizations, including tennis clubs, academies, schools and animal shelters, to collect materials and ensure they 
are put to good use.

Projects 
Bounce Back Project 
The Focus of Our Efforts 
Nearly all of the 330 million tennis balls produced each year end up in landfills, where they can take more than 400 
years to decompose. The Bounce Back Project reduces waste by finding creative ways to give used tennis balls a 
second life. 
What We Do 
Collection: We reach out to tennis clubs and academies across the Bay Area and offer to handle all logistics. Every 
month our team collects between 3,000 and 5,000 used balls from local clubs. By managing pickup ourselves we 
remove the hassle and cost of shipping, making recycling simple and convenient for our partners. 
Reuse: Collected balls are donated to schools, animal shelters and assisted living centers. In schools they are placed 
on chair legs to reduce noise and protect floors; in animal shelters they become enrichment toys; in assisted living 
centers they are attached to walker feet to improve safety and mobility. 
Impact: Since launching just over a year ago we have collected more than 100,000 tennis balls and donated over 
30,000 to organizations that can use them effectively. 
Get Involved: Clubs interested in participating can visit the Partners page or contact us directly to arrange a pickup. 
Tech to Treasure 
A Device’s Second Chance 
Millions of electronics are discarded each year, often without proper recycling, contributing to growing e‑waste and 
environmental harm. Tech to Treasure addresses this issue while inspiring the next generation of innovators. 
What We Do

Collection & Education: We gather unused electronic devices and transform them into educational tools. Our free, 
interactive workshop invites students to explore what’s inside devices like old laptops. Participants learn about key 
components such as RAM, memory, circuit boards and power systems. 
Hands‑On Learning: During each session students disassemble devices under guidance, gaining hands‑on 
knowledge of how everyday technology works. This approach ignites curiosity about STEM while highlighting the 
importance of recycling. 
Responsible Recycling: After the educational sessions all parts are responsibly recycled through Best Buy’s 
e‑waste program.

Eco‑Fillament  
The New Building Blocks of Society 
Eco‑Fillament repurposes plastic waste (collected from trash cleanups in local parks) into 3d printer filament used to 
develop toys and tools for kids with special needs. It’s a simple yet effective way to keep plastic out of landfills and 
give it a second life.
