# pdf-extract (Generated PDF Artifacts)

This folder contains generated artifacts extracted from `Bin to Better_ Website Content & Outline.pdf`.

Contents:
- `text.md`: PDF text extracted page-by-page (used to verify and copy content accurately)
- `images/`: embedded images extracted from the PDF
- `images.json`: index describing extracted images (page/xref/metadata)

Notes:
- These files are kept for traceability and repeatability.
- Production assets used by the deployed static site live under `html-site/` (e.g., `html-site/images/pdf/`).
